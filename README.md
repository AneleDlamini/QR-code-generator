# QR-code-generator
This project makes use of NodeJS and npm (Node Package Modules) to generate a QR code for a site inputted by the user. The QR image is saved locally in the project folder and the name of the site is written to a texfile.

Ensure that you have the correct modules installed before running the code by running the following in your terminal: 
1. npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
2. npm install qr-image

Most importantly, ensure that you have NodeJS installed in your device. Initialise npm using <i>npm init</i> in your terminal to configure npm and include <i>"type": 'module'</i> in configuration json file.
